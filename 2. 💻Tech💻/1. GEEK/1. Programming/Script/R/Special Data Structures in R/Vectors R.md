 #R   
## Vector
It's quiet like an array in other languages, they are the same type
```R
# Vector of strings  
fruits <- c("banana", "apple", "orange")  
  
# Print fruits  
fruits
```
```R
  
# Vector of numerical values  
numbers <- c(1, 2, 3)  
  
# Print numbers  
numbers
```
```R
numbers <- seq(from = 0, to = 100, by = 20)  
# 0  20  40  60  80 100
numbers
```
