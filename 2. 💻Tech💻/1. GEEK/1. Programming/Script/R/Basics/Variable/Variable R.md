## Variable
Other than other languages. In R they use <- sign to define a variable
```R
name <- "R"
num <- 50
```
To output a variable just write the variable name or when you want, you can also use print()
```R
name
num

print(name)
```

You can also print the variable with other strings, In R they use paste() for it
```R
text <- "hehe"

paste("bruh", text)
```

R allows you to assign the same value to multiple variables in one line:
```R
# Assign the same value to multiple variables in one line  
var1 <- var2 <- var3 <- "Orange"  
  
# Print variable values  
var1  
var2  
var3
```
