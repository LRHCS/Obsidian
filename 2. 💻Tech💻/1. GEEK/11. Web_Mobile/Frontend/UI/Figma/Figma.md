#UI
only use the multiples of 4 for the size and distance

Every Icon is combined with simple elements, we just need to disassembly it

In a figma Project, the elements in a Page is based on **Component** and The colors in **color styles**

In Prototype we can control the jumping from different page

With help with layout grid we can design a much more beautiful and organised site.
