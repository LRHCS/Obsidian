## Where is the internet?
**The last mile** is the part of the internet that connects homes and small businesses to the internet. Currently, [about 60 percent](http://www.leichtmanresearch.com/research/notes03_2015.pdf) of residential internet connections in the United States are provided by cable TV companies such as Comcast and Time Warner. Of the remaining 40 percent, a growing fraction use new fiber optic cables, most of which are part of Verizon’s FiOS program or AT&T’s U-Verse. Finally, a significant but shrinking number use outdated DSL service provided over telephone cables.

**Data centers**are rooms full of servers that store user data and host online apps and content. Some are owned by large companies such as Google and Facebook. Others are commercial facilities that provide service to many smaller websites. Data centers have very fast internet connections, allowing them to serve many users simultaneously. Data centers can be located anywhere in the world, but they are often located in remote areas where land and electricity are cheap. For example, [Google](http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2013/12/02/in-iowa-a-field-becomes-a-huge-google-server-farm/), [Facebook](http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2013/11/facebook-iowa-wind/), and [Microsoft](http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2013/06/microsoft-iowa-data-center/) have all constructed vast data centers in Iowa.

**The backbone** consists of long-distance networks — mostly on fiber optic cables — that carry data between data centers and consumers. The backbone market is highly competitive. Backbone providers frequently connect their networks together at [internet exchange points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Internet_exchange_points_by_size), usually located in major cities. Establishing a presence at IEPs makes it much easier for backbone providers to improve their connections to others.

## Who created the internet?
[ARPANET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET)
 The project was led by [Bob Taylor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Taylor_(computer_scientist)), an ARPA administrator, and the network was built by the consulting firm of Bolt, Beranek and Newman. It began operations in **1969**.
 [Vint Cerf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vint_Cerf) and [Bob Kahn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Kahn) began work on the next generation of networking standards for the ARPANET. These standards, known as [TCP/IP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite), became the foundation of the modern internet.
TCPIP is many standards

## What’s an IP address?
Internet Protocol addresses are numbers that computers use to identify each other on the internet. An ICANN department known as the [Internet Assigned Numbers Authority](https://www.iana.org/) is responsible for distributing IP addresses to ensure that two different organizations don’t use the same address.

## What is IPv6?
The current internet standard, known as IPv4, only allows for about 4 billion IP addresses. This was considered a very big number in the 1970s, but today, the supply of IPv4 addresses is nearly exhausted.

So internet engineers have developed a new standard called [IPv6.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6) IPv6 allows for a mind-boggling number of unique addresses — the exact figure is [39 digits long](http://royal.pingdom.com/2009/05/26/the-number-of-possible-ipv6-addresses-read-out-loud/) — ensuring that the world will never again run out.

## What is a packet?
basic unit of information transmitted over the internet
A packet has two parts. The [header](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4#Header) contains information that helps the packet get to its **destination**, including the **length** of the packet, its **source** and **destination**, and a **checksum** value that helps the recipient detect if a packet was damaged in transit. After the header comes the actual data.

## What is the World Wide Web?
The web was created by [Timothy Berners-Lee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee), a computer programmer at the European scientific research organization [CERN](http://home.web.cern.ch/), in 1991. In 1994, Berners-Lee created the [World Wide Web Consortium](http://www.w3.org/) (W3C) to be the web’s official standards organization. He is still the W3C’s director and continues to oversee the development of web standards.
## What’s a web browser?
A web browser is a computer program that allows users to download and view websites. Web browsers are available for desktop computers, tablets, and mobile phones.
