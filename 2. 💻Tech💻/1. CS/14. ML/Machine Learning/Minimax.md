In this algorithm, there are two players, such as: Player O and Player X
if O wins, the game will return -1, if X wins, the game will return 1, if nobody wins, it returns 0
O is trying to get the lowest number, so it is a **min-player**
X is trying to get the biggest number, so it is a **max-player**
