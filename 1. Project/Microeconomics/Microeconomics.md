# Defination
How Individuels and firm make decisions in a world of **"scarcity"**
- Series of **constrained** **optimization** exercises
- tradeoffs
- notion of opportunity cost
	- everything you do have a better alternative you could have done instead

# Model

## Supply and Demand Model
![[Pasted image 20230806212625.png || 400]]

### Demand Curve(how consumer make choises)
- Demand Curve: When Price is high, the person want few of them


#### Utility Maximization


##### 1. Consumer Preference(Happiness)
- Preference Assumptions
	1. Completeness(must have preference, = > <, not I dont know)
	2. Transitivity
	3. Non Satiation Assumption -> more is better
- Indifference Curve(Graphical Maps of Preference)
	- ![[Pasted image 20230807160719.png|| 400]]
	1. Consumers prefer higher indifference Curve
	2. Indifference Curves are downward sloping
	3. Indifference Curves never cross
	4. There is only one IC through every bundle
- Utility Functions
	- Margin Utility(Do you want the next cookie > How many cookies do you want, **It is always diminishing, the more you have it, the less you want the next from it**)
		- such as Starbucks and McDonald. They gives you twice as much liquid for less than twice as much money(Diminishing Margin Utility)

	- ![[Pasted image 20230807162018.png|| 400]]
	- Maginal Rate of Subsitution = $\frac{\Delta P} {\Delta C}$ = $\frac{-MU_c} {MU_p}$

##### 2. Budget Constraint
- Assumption: Budget = Income
	- $Y = P_p *P + P_c * C$
	- ![[Pasted image 20230807184345.png|| 400]]
	- MRT(Maginal Rate of Transformation) = $\frac{-p_c} {p_p}$
	- ![[Pasted image 20230807185947.png|| 400]]
	- opportunity set: Set of choises when given the income and the market prices

##### 3. Contrained Choise
- ![[Pasted image 20230807191134.png|| 400]]
- A: The marginal benifit to me of another cookie relative to another pizza is greater than the market trade in pizza for cookies


### Supply Curve(how firms make production decisions)
- Supply Curve: When More and more people want it, the firms will produce more of the product


- Market equilibrium: Bothe cutomer and firm are happy

- low supply high demand lead to a high price
- low demand high supply lead to a low price

# Market Analyses
## Positive analyses
study the way things are

## Normative analyses
the way things should be 

### Results
- Market Failure
	- Reasons why the Market doesn't work in the wonderful way economists like it should
		- fraud
		- imperfect information
- Equity and Fairness
- Behavieral Economics

# Economie
## Capitalism Econ
- Different Firms make production and consumption decision
- individuels and firms serving their own best interest will do what is the best for society
	- most stuff get produced and consumed(maximum surplus)
- Bad Equality
## Command Econ
- Goverment make production and consumption decision
- too many coruption
- hard to control human nature
