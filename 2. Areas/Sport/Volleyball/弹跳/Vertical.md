1. Control and stability(Coordination)
2. General Strength
3. Range of Motion(Flexibility)
4. Maximum Stength(Squat, Deadlift, Bench Press)
5. Maximum Power(Move a heavy load fast, faster than 4)
6. Starting Stength
7. Force Absorption Training
8. Reactive Traning(plyometric training, reversal strength, elastic strength, and static-spring proficiency)
9. Short response reactive traning
10. Speed of movement/Quickness/Velocity

**Spectacular vertical jump = High levels of force + High speed of force application**

You must use fairly heavy loads and **apply force against the resistance quickly** so that your body learns to generate maximum force quickly. This recruits more fast twitch muscle fibers and trains the nervous system to engage more muscle fibers

1. 0-25% Speed traning
2. 25%-50% Speed-Strength
3. 55%-80% Stength-Speed üí™
4. 80%-100% Maximum Strength üí™

When training with specific strength, use a weight that will not change your technique

eliminate CNS inhibition without needing an adrenaline surge or life or death situation to do

reactive movement: Basically the muscle cells lock up as the tendons stretch. The body **stabilizes this
negative force, stores this force, and then ‚Äúreleases‚Äù this force** like a spring

decrease amortization phase:  time between your foot contacting the ground and being able to leave again

Plyometric: 
1. **Light reactive exercises**: jump rope, toe and ankle bounces, side- to-side line jumps, and low stair jumps
	- relaxation, lack of strain
2. **Moderate standing "power" or "up" variety exercises**:  on-box jumps (jumping on a box from the ground), standing broad jumps, 1-leg step-up jumps and un-weighted squat jumps
	-  apply max force instantaneously without a large involvement of the reflexive stretch shortening cycle
3. Moderate reactive exercises:  low-box depth jumps , lateral cone jumps, jumps over hurdle
4. High intensity reactive exercises: depth jumps and drop jumps, shock jumps
	- A depth jump entails jumping or stepping off of a bench or object and immediately jumping up as highas possible at ground contact. 
		- .2 second on the ground
		- height is between 18-28 inches(45 - 71 cm), land as far as the height
		- no more than 4 sets of 10 reps, 2-3 times per week, 3 sets of 5-8 reps
	- A shock jump is pure energy absorption training and consists of jumping off of a very high object and simply landing and absorbing the impact. 

1. Jumps: 2 legs
2. Hops: 1 leg
3. Bounds: take off on one foot land on the other 

The plyometric exercises can cause a fatigue of our nerve system, we need to train intelligently and have enough pause

Example 12 week cycle
- Week 1-3: Higher volume lower and moderate intensity jump training (i.e. single and double leg jumps, hops, skips ‚Äì depth jumps up to 18 inches)
- Week 4-6: High volume weights + low volume low intensity jump training
- Week 7-9: Moderate volume accelerated weight training (jump squats, speed pulls) + low volume shock jumps (depth drops)
- Week 10-12: Low volume general weights + high volume depth jumps
