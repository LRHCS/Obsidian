> Childhood is measured out by sounds and smells, and sights, before the dark hour of reason grows - John Betjeman


This is a literature from the author John Boyne wrote in 2006.


In this book, a boy names Bruno is moving from Berlin to Out-With(Auschwitz), because of his father(a commandant from nazi german), his job is to rule the Auschwitz. At first Bruno stayed at home normally, then he went on the adventure, he want to explore. He goes to the fences that he saw in his room. When he is there, he sees a boy in the striped pyjama, his name is shmuel, a jew. They became friend. One day he has to polish the glasses in bruno's father's birthday party. Leutkonant Kotler found out that Bruno gives Shmuel food, that is not allowed. A week later he sees bruising on Shmuel's face. After a year, Bruno has to remove all of his hair because there are lice on it(looks similar as the person in ausschwitz). his mother is very boring there, nobody to talk with, his father decide to go back to Berlin. But Bruno still wants to play and explore with Shmuel(He can't find his father anymore). Bruno goes inside the Auschwitz with shmuel, after the exploration, they have to go on a "march". After that they are being poisoned in the Gas Chamber by the Nazis German. 


The Author used the conversation between these two kid to show that Bruno is to young to naive, he thinks everybody on this world is equal and everybody have a similar life at that time, everytime when Shmuel saids something sad about the inside Bruno will associate it with something good from outside, this causes the tragedy at the end. After the Birthday Party from Father, i thinks Bruno has thinked about is he still a freind from shmuel, but they are still kids and don't know much, so yeah, they are still friend.


I think it's a good book to read, because the language is simple and clear, and this book is not too long. Sometimes, when the author want to describe something brutal(Carnavage), he uses some metapher, instead describe it directly, I think it's because the main focus from this book is the kid, they shouldn't read something like that.
