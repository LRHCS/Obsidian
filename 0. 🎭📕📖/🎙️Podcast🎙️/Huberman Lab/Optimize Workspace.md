> **Focus**: Monitor up up tp 45 min with 5 min rest, Blue(Cold) Light, Sit straight up, Drink much water, 40hz of binaral beats, higher screen brightness


> **Analytic** : Low Ceiling, 0-8 Hour


> **Creatively**: High Ceiling, 9-16 Hour


> **Sleepy**: Monitor down , Cold Light, Sit backwards a little, lower screen brightness


# Light
Morning: As more light as you can, 30 minutes after wakeup need sunlight. Blue Light
Evening: Turn off Overhead light
Screenbrightness: Different by people's eyecolor, darker eyes can tolerate more sunlight then lighter
after 6am-7am turn the lights in a warmer color and dimm the light
- when you want to work at that time, you should do a trade off
- if you want to stay awake at night, you can drink more water to stay alert and bright light


# Visual Focus
The Eye Muscle can affect alertness
- The muscle that makes you look down makes you more sleepy
- The muscle that makes you look up makes you more alert

When our Body leans back, our body will feel sleepy

Place your monitor in a correct distance(so far that you have the overview of your monitor)
- restrict your visual window
- this focus can only last 45 minutes, we need at least 5 minutes of rest
	- look at the horizon


## Environment affect creativity and analytical thinking
- Cathedral Effect(Higer Ceiling)
	- 9-16 hours after wake-up: creative
	- Within a place with higher ceiling, you can be more creative
- Lower Ceiling
	- Artificil Lower Ceiling
		- Cap
		- Hoodie
	- 0-8 hours after wake-up: Analytical, detailed
	- Analytic, detailed, correct-answer type work


# Audio Envirement
don't tolerate background noice
- sometimes with some types of background noice, it will improve your focus
long-time and loud white noice may cause damage in brain

1. repeatable beats
2. binaral beats
	- alpha wave/ theta waves
	- 40hz
	- pure sound is more affective
	- listen to this sound before work
		- our brain need some time
3. isocronic tons
	- with different tons at each ears will improve our focus because our brain will do some math to balanced the different two sounds


# Interuption 
- Don't place your desk face to the door, it's not good for foucs
- When somebody else has a question, don't lean towards them or just say no
- Airplane mode   


# Movement
- Both position sitting and standing are good for us
- reducing half of sitting time will improve focus
- With a treadmilling or cycling will improve our cognition better decrese the verbal recall
