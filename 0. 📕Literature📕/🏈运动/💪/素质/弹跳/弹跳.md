# Intro

vertical jump is basically just a measurement of power
Power = **Force x Velocity**
Force = **Mass x Acceleration**
power and explosive strength simply mean the ability to **apply a lot of force in minimal time**. The more force you can put out and the faster you can apply that force, the higher your power output will be
**how much force you can put out in a short period of time is going to determine performance**

# 10 Key Performance Qualities
1. Control and stability
	- be able to stabilize and **control your own bodyweight** and control minimal loads
2. General Strength
	- strengthen the muscles involved by **adding additional loading**
	- An emphasis should be placed on **correct technique** with less emphasis on the load.
3. Range of Motion
	- flexibility
4. Maximum Strength
	- strengthening the musculature by lifting maximum loads
5. Maximum Power
	- can qualify as power training as long as there is some load that must be moved and you “focus” on moving fast
6. Starting Strength
	- ability to instantly apply lots of force at the very beginning of a movement
7. Force Absorption Training
	- ability to **absorb and stabilize high eccentric or negative forces** and is the first step in developing great plyometric power
8. Reactive training
	- plyometric training, reversal strength, elastic strength, and static-spring proficiency
9. Short response reactive training
10. Speed of movement/Quickness/Velocity

The main determining outcome in the vertical jump isn’t how fast your legs move, it’s the **amount of force relative to your bodyweight that you are able to put into the ground**
Spectacular vertical jump = High levels of force + High speed of force application

# Weight Training
- The training of bodybuildung wont devolop a lot of strength, only the size of the muscel
- you must use **fairly heavy loads and apply force against the resistance quickly** so that your body learns to generate maximum force quickly
## Loads
- Speed training (0-25% of maximum)
	- be used to train speed of movement and rate of force development but has little benefit for improving maximal force production
- Speed-strength (25-50% of maximum)
	- get gains in force development and speed, however the gains in maximal force production will be marginal.
- Strength-speed (55-80% of maximum)
	- the best compromise between speed and strength with strength (maximal force) being the dominant quality affected
	- Training in this zone will give you gains in both rate of force development and strength with a marginal gain in speed
- Maximum strength (80-100% of maximum)
	- Here strength and force are maximized

# Plans
## PLYOMETRIC
### NOVICE PLYOMETRICS PROGRAM
Phase I- 3 times weekly on non-consecutive days (Monday, Wednesday, Friday or Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday) – On the 3rd week skip the 3rd workout and test.

Phase II- Same frequency as Phase I 
![[Pasted image 20230205125158.png]]
Phase III- 2 times weekly with at least 2 full days rest between workouts. Skip the 2nd workout on the 3rd week and test.

Phase IV- Same Frequency as Phase III
![[Pasted image 20230205125225.png]]


### INTERMEDIATE PLYOMETRIC PROGRAM
2 times per week with at least 2 full days between workouts. On the final week of each phase test first and then perform the workout. At the conclusion of the entire program take an entire week off then re-test.
