# ping

The ping command is used when we want to test whether a connection to a remote resource is possible. Usually this will be a website on the internet, but it could also be for a computer on your home network if you want to check if it's configured correctly. Ping works using the ICMP protocol, which is one of the slightly less well-known TCP/IP protocols that were mentioned earlier. The ICMP protocol works on the Network layer of the OSI Model, and thus the Internet layer of the TCP/IP model. The basic syntax for ping is `ping <target>`. In this example we are using ping to test whether a network connection to Google is possible:

Notice that the ping command actually returned the IP address for the Google server that it connected to, rather than the URL that was requested. This is a handy secondary application for ping, as it can be used to determine the IP address of the server hosting a website. One of the big advantages of ping is that it's pretty much ubiquitous to any network enabled device. All operating systems support it out of the box, and even most embedded devices can use ping!

#  traceroute

The logical follow-up to the ping command is 'traceroute'. Traceroute can be used to map the path your request takes as it heads to the target machine.  
  
The internet is made up of many, many different servers and end-points, all networked up to each other. This means that, in order to get to the content you actually want, you first need to go through a bunch of other servers. Traceroute allows you to see each of these connections -- it allows you to see every intermediate step between your computer and the resource that you requested. The basic syntax for traceroute on Linux is this: `traceroute <destination>`

By default, the Windows traceroute utility (`tracert`) operates using the same ICMP protocol that ping utilises, and the Unix equivalent operates over UDP. This can be altered with switches in both instances.

# whois

Domain Names -- the unsung saviours of the internet.

Can you imagine how it would feel to remember the IP address of every website you want to visit? Horrible thought.

Fortunately, we've got domains.

We'll talk a little bit more about how this works in the next task, but for now suffice to know that a domain translates into an IP address so that we don't need to remember it (e.g. you can type tryhackme.com, rather than the TryHackMe IP address). Domains are leased out by companies called Domain Registrars. If you want a domain, you go and register with a registrar, then lease the domain for a certain length of time. 

Enter Whois.

Whois essentially allows you to query who a domain name is registered to. In Europe personal details are redacted; however, elsewhere you can potentially get a great deal of information from a whois search.

There is a [web version](https://www.whois.com/whois/) of the whois tool if you're particularly adverse to the command line. Either way, let's get started!

_(Note: You may need to install whois before using it. On Debian based systems this can be done with_ `sudo apt update && sudo apt-get install whois`_)_

Whois lookups are very easy to perform. Just use `whois <domain>` to get a list of available information about the domain registration:

# dig

When you visit a website in your web browser this all happens automatically, but we can also do it manually with a tool called `dig` . Like ping and traceroute, dig should be installed automatically on Linux systems.

Dig allows us to manually query recursive DNS servers of our choice for information about domains:  
`dig <domain> @<dns-server-ip>`

It is a very useful tool for network troubleshooting.

This is a _lot_ of information. We're currently most interested in the `ANSWER` section for this room; however, taking the time to learn what the rest of this means is a very good idea. In summary, that information is telling us that we sent it one query and successfully (i.e. No Errors) received one full answer -- which, as expected, contains the IP address for the domain name that we queried.

Another interesting piece of information that dig gives us is the TTL (**T**ime **T**o **L**ive) of the queried DNS record. As mentioned previously, when your computer queries a domain name, it stores the results in its local cache. The TTL of the record tells your computer when to stop considering the record as being valid -- i.e. when it should request the data again, rather than relying on the cached copy.

The TTL can be found in the second column of the answer section:

![Results demonstrating that the TTL of the DNS record is 157](https://muirlandoracle.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/TTL.png)

It's important to remember that TTL (in the context of DNS caching) is measured in _seconds,_ so the record in the example will expire in two minutes and thirty-seven seconds.

Have a go at some questions about DNS and dig.
