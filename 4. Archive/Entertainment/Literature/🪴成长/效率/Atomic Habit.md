# 1% Rule
If you become 1% better each day, then you will be 36($1.01^{365}$) times better after a year


# 3 Layers
![[Pasted image 20230513220756.png]]
1. Outcome
2. Habits and Systems for the result
3. Identity, worldview

The change from 3 to 1 is better then 1 to 3. Change Identity first, because your habits are how you embody your identity

1. Decide the type of person you want to be. 
2. Prove it to yourself with small wins.


# 4 Steps
behaviors followed by **satisfying consequences** tend to be repeated 

> Your habits are just a series of automatic solutions that solve the problems, Habits are mental shortcuts learned from experience


1. Cue
	- Initiate the behaviour and predict a reward
2. Craving
	- What you crave is not the habit itself but the **change in state it delivers**
3. Response(actual habit)
	- Your response also depends on your ability(diszipline)
	- a habit can occur only if you are capable of doing it
4. Reward
	- This is always the end goal of every habit
	1. satisfy your craving
	2. which actions are worth remembering in the future

## Four Laws of Behavior Change

- Good Habit
The 1st law (Cue): Make it **obvious**. 
The 2nd law (Craving): Make it **attractive**. 
The 3rd law (Response): Make it **easy**. 
The 4th law (Reward): Make it **satisfying**.


- Bad Habit
Inversion of the 1st law (Cue): Make it **invisible**. 
Inversion of the 2nd law (Craving): Make it **unattractive**. 
Inversion of the 3rd law (Response): Make it **difficult**. 
Inversion of the 4th law (Reward): Make it **unsatisfying**.


### The 1st law(**Obvious**)
You can notice an opportunity and take action without dedicating conscious attention to it.
> Habits are the things you do nonconsiciously
We need to make our nonconsicious behavior more **consicious, visible**
- With a Habit Scoreboard by making every habit visible and determine it as good or bad, can make our lives more visible 

#### Implementation Intention
> is a plan(**When, Where, What**) you make beforehand about when and where to act

#### Habit Stacking
After a Habit, i will do another Habit immediatley

#### Environment
> Behavior is a function of the Person in their Environment
many of the actions we take each day are shaped not by purposeful drive and choice but by the **most obvious option**
place the cues(triggers) at a more visible place
**One place, one use**

#### Self-Control
> You can break a habit, but you’re unlikely to forget it


### The 2nd law(**Attractive**)
[[Dopamine]]
- dopamine-driven feedback loop
- Every behavior that is highly habit-forming is associated with higher levels of dopamine
- When a habit is different to do, do a mind shift, think it positivly


### THE 3RD LAW(**Easy**)
Take action, don't wait
**action** > motion

start from a easy target build up the consistency, then do it harder.
- two minutes rule
have a better environment(addtion by subtraction)

to give up a bad habit you should make it more difficult

- Goldilocks Rule
![[Pasted image 20230514192809.png]]
keep the difficulty in this area

### THE 4TH LAW(**Satisfying**)
With our bad habits, the immediate outcome usually feels good, but the ultimate outcome feels bad. 
With good habits, it is the reverse: **the immediate outcome is unenjoyable, but the ultimate outcome feels good**

We should keep our habit on track, with a tick on calendar, it's satisfying
