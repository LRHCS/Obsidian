inner game is the mind of a player
- lapses in concentration, nervousness, self-doubt, and self-condemnation
- overcome all habits of mind which inhibit excellence in performance
play out of the mind
- dont think to much(how to hit, how to swing...)
- still mind(concentrated, focused)
	- automatic functions are working without interference from thoughts
Self 1(conscious teller) and Self 2(unconscious, automatic doer)
- Learning to program your computer Self 2 **with images rather than instructing yourself with words;** 
- Learning to "trust thyself" (Self 2) to do what you (Self 1) ask of it. This means letting Self 2 hit the ball; 
- Learning to see "nonjudgmentally" - that is, to see what is happening rather than merely noticing how well or how badly it is happening.
peak experiences("flow")
- During such experiences, the mind does not act like a separate entity telling you what you should do or criticizing how you do it. It is quiet; you are "together," and the action flows as free as a river
- we are concentrating without trying to concentrate
- **Quieting the mind**
1. the art of **letting go the human inclination to judge ourselves** and our performance as either good or bad

At a shot we don't want to think to much, if we do our **muscles tighten when they need to be loose, strokes become awkward and less fluid, and negative evaluations are likely to continue** with growing intensity.

- "You become what you think”
First the mind judges the event, then group events, then identifies with the combined event, and finally judges itself
a lousy serve ->"I'm serving badly today”-> "I have a terrible serve”-> "I'm a lousy tennis player," -> 'Tm no good”
**Relaxation** produces smooth strokes and results from accepting your strokes as they are, even if erratic
positiv thinking is like a prehabit of negative thinking
- Compliments are criticisms in disguise! Both are used to manipulate behavior, and compliments are just more socially acceptable!
